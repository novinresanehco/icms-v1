## II. Deployment Requirements

```yaml
deployment_control:
  verification:
    code_review:
      - static_analysis
      - security_scan
      - dependency_check
    testing:
      - unit_tests
      - integration_tests
      - security_tests
    validation:
      - performance_check
      - security_audit
      - compliance_verify

  process:
    stages:
      - development
      - staging
      - production
    controls:
      - approval_required
      - security_check
      - rollback_ready
    monitoring:
      - real_time
      - automated
      - logged

  protection:
    backup:
      type: full_system
      frequency: pre_deployment
      verification: required
    security:
      scan: mandatory
      approval: required
